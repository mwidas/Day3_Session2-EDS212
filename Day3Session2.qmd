## Vectors in R

```{r}
#creating a vector 
marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow", TRUE)
#check the class 
#in a vector class has to be the same so if they are not they will go to the most flexible category so they are the same thing
class(marmots)
#call something back to show it underneath
marmots
```

## Create a Numeric Vector

```{r}
#creating a numeric vector
pika <- c(12.4, 6.8, 2.9, 8.8, 5)
#hint is shown in environment next to []
#class is often run just in console
class(pika)
```

```{r}
#to make something a class of integer use a capital L after the number
bear <- c(20L, 3L, 18L)
```

### Vector addition and subtraction

```{r}
ringtail <- c(4.3, 8.9, 2.6, 7.1)

fox <- c(3, 5, 6, 7)

ringtail_fox <- ringtail + fox

ringtail_fox

ringtail_minus_fox <- ringtail - fox

#scalar multiplier
100 * ringtail

#dot product
ringtail %*% fox
```

## Here is my new change
